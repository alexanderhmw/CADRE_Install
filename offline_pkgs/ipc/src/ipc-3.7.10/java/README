The Java version of IPC has currently been tested only under Linux
(specifically RedHat 6.2, RedHat 7.0 and 7.1, Mandrake 8.1) and Solaris.

To make IPC for Java on your system, you may need to edit the GNUmakefile,
changing the location of the include files to point to your Java installation.
In particular, search for the occurrences of INC_PATH in the GNUmakefile in
this directory, and replace the appropriate lines so that the compiler can
find jni.h and jni_md.h

After editing the GNUmakefile, just type "gmake install" and everything
should happen automatically (actually, you need to do a "gmake install" in
the ipc/src directory first, in order to make libipc.a).  After completing,
you should have a number of classes in this directory, and libipcjava.so in
the ../lib/<sys> directory (where <sys> is Linux, for instance).

To run the Java IPC, you need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable to include the directory where libipcjava.so is found (see above).
You also need to set the CLASSPATH environment variable to include the
ipc/java directory.  For instance:
> setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${HOME}/code/ipc/lib/Linux-2.4"
> setenv CLASSPATH "${CLASSPATH}:${HOME}/code/ipc/java"

There are Java test programs in the ipc/test directory to give you some
indication of how to use the Java version of IPC.  The manual will be
updated shortly to give more complete instructions.
