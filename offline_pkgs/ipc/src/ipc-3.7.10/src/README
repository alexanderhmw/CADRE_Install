See the INSTALL file in this directory for how to install the C version of the
IPC (generally, you won't have to do this -- it's already installed).

To use the IPC, you need to link with the IPC library.  There are shareable
versions (libipc.so.*) and static versions (libipc.a).  In general, the load
command should include "-L$(IPC_DIR) -lipc", which will allow the
linker to use the shareable library, if possible.

See the file ../test/README for instructions on making and running test code.
