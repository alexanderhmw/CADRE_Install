Description: Open Source Bayesian Filtering Classes
    Bayes++ is an open source library of C++ classes. These classes represent
 and implement a wide variety of numerical algorithms for Bayesian Filtering of
 discrete systems. The classes provide tested and consistent numerical methods
 and the class hierarchy explicitly represents the variety of filtering
 algorithms and system model types.
