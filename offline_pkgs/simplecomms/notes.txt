To port the simplecomms .deb to a new version of Ubuntu, go into src/.
Add a line to src/debian/changelog in the correct format, indicating your
change.  Use an incremented version number.
Run 'scons' in src/
 Fix any compile errors which will probably just be
 some #include directives due to version change of gcc.

Run 'make package' in src/.

The resulting .deb will show up back in this directory.

Some of the changes made by curmson in 
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~curmson/SimpleComms.tgz
have been integrated into this version, namely the removed dependency
on boost_program-options
